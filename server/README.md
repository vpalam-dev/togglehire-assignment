# Toggl Hire homework - server

This project uses [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/) to run a GraphQL server. You can read about how gqlgen works in the documentation. For this assignment you only need to know how to implement [resolvers](https://gqlgen.com/reference/resolvers/).

Some of the code in this projects has been generated by gqlgen. To re-generate the code based on the GraphQL schema, run `go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen`.

You can run the server with `go run server.go`. By default it uses the port 8080 and you can access the GraphQL playground at http://localhost:8080.
