This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can start the development server by running `yarn start`.

The app uses [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) to connect to the GraphQL server (running at http://localhost:8080) and fetch a list of questions. These are rendered as JSON for demonstration purposes. For this assignment you only need to know the [basics of the React bindings](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/basics/react-preact/).
